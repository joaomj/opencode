# To Tickets

Break a plan, spec, or conversation into a set of **tickets** — tracer-bullet vertical slices, each declaring the tickets that **block** it.

## Process

### 1. Gather context

Work from whatever is already in the conversation context. If the user passes a reference (a spec path, an issue number or URL) as an argument, fetch it and read its full body and comments.

### 2. Explore the codebase

If you have not already explored the codebase, do so to understand the current state of the code. Ticket titles and descriptions should use the project's domain glossary vocabulary, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

Look for opportunities to prefactor the code to make the implementation easier. "Make the change easy, then make the easy change."

### 3. Draft vertical slices

Break the work into **tracer bullet** tickets:

- Each slice cuts a narrow but COMPLETE path through every layer (schema, API, UI, tests) — vertical, NOT a horizontal slice of one layer
- A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own
- Each slice is sized to fit in a single fresh context window
- Any prefactoring should be done first

Give each ticket its **blocking edges** — the other tickets that must complete before it can start. A ticket with no blockers can start immediately.

**Wide refactors are the exception to vertical slicing.** A **wide refactor** is one mechanical change whose blast radius fans across the whole codebase, so no vertical slice can land green. Sequence it as **expand-contract**: add the new form beside the old, migrate call sites in batches, then delete the old form once no caller remains.

### 4. Quiz the user

Present the proposed breakdown as a numbered list. For each ticket, show:
- **Title**: short descriptive name
- **Blocked by**: which other tickets (if any) must complete first
- **What it delivers**: the end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work

Ask the user:
- Does the granularity feel right? (too coarse / too fine)
- Are the blocking edges correct?
- Should any tickets be merged or split further?

Iterate until the user approves the breakdown.

### 5. Publish the tickets

Publish the approved tickets. Each ticket gets a `Status: ready-for-agent` label.

Work the **frontier** — any ticket whose blockers are all done.

## Workflow position

```
grill-with-docs → to-spec → to-tickets → implement
```

Use after the spec exists. Proposes ticket breakdown, asks for approval on granularity and dependencies, then publishes tickets in dependency order.
